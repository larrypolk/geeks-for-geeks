Given an array *A* of *N* elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array *A* of size *N* is an element that appears more than *N*/2 times.

### Input:  

The first line of the input contains *T* denoting the number of test cases. The first line of the test case will be the size of array and second line will be the elements of the array.

###Output:

For each test case the output will be the majority element of the array.

#### Constraints:
1 <= T<= 100<br />
1 <= N <= 103<br />
0 <= Ai <= 103<br />

### Example:

5
3 1 3 3 2
3
1 2 3
```
